  'Use Lucene Query Syntax to construct powerful search queries. Use operators such as "AND" to find documents with all terms, "OR" to find documents with at least one term, "NOT" to exclude terms, "+" to require terms, "-" to exclude terms, "?" to match a single character, "" to match any number of characters, and double quotes to search for exact phrases. For example, "apple AND pie", "apple OR pie", "apple NOT pie", "apple +pie", "apple -pie", "app?", "app", and "apple pie".   ';
